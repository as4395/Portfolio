## Fonts

# This section configures the fonts used in your Kitty terminal.

# Font Family:
# You can set the primary font family here. If you want specific fonts for
# bold, italic, or bold-italic text, you can specify them separately.
# By default, Kitty tries to automatically derive these variants from your
# operating system's font system. Setting them manually is useful for
# font families that have many weight variants (e.g., "Book", "Medium", "Thick").
#
# To see a list of all font family names available on your computer,
# run `kitty list-fonts` in your terminal.
# The default values shown below rely on your OS to choose an appropriate monospace font.
font_family               JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono
bold_font                 auto
italic_font               Operator Mono Bold Italic
bold_italic_font          auto

# Font Size:
# This sets the size of the font in points (pts).
# NOTE: It's best to avoid odd values for font size, as they can sometimes
# affect how Kitty renders margins and spacing.
font_size                 11

## Key Mappings

# These are keyboard shortcuts for quickly switching between tabs.
# For example, `cmd+1` will take you to tab 1, `cmd+2` to tab 2, and so on.
map cmd+1 goto_tab 1
map cmd+2 goto_tab 2
map cmd+3 goto_tab 3
map cmd+4 goto_tab 4
map cmd+5 goto_tab 5
map cmd+6 goto_tab 6
map cmd+7 goto_tab 7
map cmd+8 goto_tab 8
map cmd+9 goto_tab 9

## Appearance & Behavior

# Background Opacity:
# Sets the transparency of the terminal window's background. A value of 1.0 is fully opaque,
# while values closer to 0.0 are more transparent.
background_opacity        0.95

# Dynamic Background Opacity:
# When set to `yes`, you can dynamically change the background opacity
# using keyboard shortcuts while Kitty is running.
dynamic_background_opacity yes

# Hide Window Decorations:
# This option allows you to hide parts of the window's native decorations (like the title bar).
# `titlebar-only` hides just the title bar, keeping other window controls (like minimize, maximize, close buttons).
hide_window_decorations titlebar-only

# Window Padding:
# This sets the amount of empty space (padding) around the content within the terminal window.
window_padding_width 5

# Audio Bell:
# Disables the system's audible "bell" sound that usually occurs on certain events (like pressing backspace too many times).
enable_audio_bell no

## Color Scheme

# This line includes another configuration file, `theme.conf`.
# This is where your terminal's color palette and other color-related settings are likely defined.
include ./theme.conf
