# if available within the 'font_family', or the OS will pick a suitable one.

# --- Window Behavior & Appearance ---

# Dynamically adjust background opacity. This allows the background to be
# more transparent when the window is not focused, and more opaque when focused.
# The 'background_opacity' setting below will serve as the maximum opacity.
dynamic_background_opacity yes

# Control the initial background opacity.
# A value of 0.95 means 95% opaque, 5% transparent.
background_opacity 0.95

# Hide window decorations. 'titlebar-only' removes only the title bar,
# keeping window controls (close, minimize, maximize) as part of the window content.
# Other options include 'no' (show all decorations) or 'yes' (hide all).
hide_window_decorations titlebar-only

# Padding between the window content and the window edge (in pixels).
window_padding_width 5

# --- Color Scheme ---

# Include an external file for color definitions.
# This keeps your main kitty.conf clean and allows for easy swapping of themes.
# Ensure 'theme.conf' is located in the same directory as this file.
